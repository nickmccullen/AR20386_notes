    "This is a _flipped_ course. The teaching of the material is online **and must be done by you first** and your learning via doing examples follows on from this in weekly workshops.\n",

    "## 1. Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Read relevant sections of this book and have a go at exercises in while watching the lectures.\n",
    "-   Do problem sets using the examples in these notes to guide you.\n",

    "## 2. Online Lectures \n",
    "\n",
    "-   You **must** have done the lectures and examples **before** the weekly In-person Workshop\n",
    "-   Lectures are for inspiration and context\n",
    "-   Make notes as you go along\n",

    "## 3. Tutorial Workshops\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two-hour hands-on computer-based workshop.\n",
    "- Expanding on the online theoretical lecture material, using computational ways of solving and investigating the mathematics.\n",
    "- Chance to work on the interactive quizzes as practice and for live feedback.\n",
    "- Additionally, your chance to ask questions and get feedback and support.\n",
    "- These are the most important part of studying the maths for this unit.\n",
    "- Maths is a *skill* that you only learn by continual practice, so these are **essential and compulsory** to do well in this unit and other subjects that rely on it in this and future years.\n",
