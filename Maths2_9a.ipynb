    "Probability theory is concerned with assigning and estimating the probability of future random events.  While probability theory cannot predict the exact outcome of the next event, for example the outcome of single coin flip, it can tell us something about the long-term behaviour of events such as a 50% chance of head or tail if we consider the average result over multiple coin flips.  The characterisation of long term behaviour is very useful in engineering for planning and design of infrastructure systems, and for design of experiments."
